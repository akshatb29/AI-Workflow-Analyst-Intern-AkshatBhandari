## Proposal: NEW
**Name:** Basic Interactions > Chitchat
**Confidence:** High
**Reasoning:** This cluster contains several messages that do not align with any existing task-oriented intents. Specifically:
*   "**I love you \ud83d\ude3d**" is a purely social, non-transactional expression that falls outside the scope of product information, logistics, or company details.
*   "**Boio**" is highly ambiguous and appears to be either noise, a typo, or a very informal/unclear social utterance that cannot be meaningfully mapped to an existing intent.

While other samples in the cluster might fit existing intents (e.g., "About my recent order" could map to `[Logistics > Order Status]`, and "Mughe hair ke oil" or "This can use for me ?" could map to `[Recommendation > Seeking Solution]` or `[About Product > Product Info]`), the presence of these unclassifiable social/ambiguous messages indicates a fundamental gap in the current taxonomy. A `[Basic Interactions > Chitchat]` intent is necessary to gracefully handle such non-core, social, or unclear user inputs, preventing misclassification and allowing for more natural conversational flows.

## Proposal: NEW
**Name:** About Product > Product Safety
**Confidence:** High
**Reasoning:** This cluster highlights a clear and significant user need to inquire about the safety of a product, its potential side effects, or its suitability for specific demographics (e.g., children). The current `[About Product > Certification]` intent is too narrow, focusing specifically on "harmful chemical free" claims or formal certifications. The samples demonstrate broader safety concerns that are not adequately covered:

*   "Age 10 year h koi side effects" - Directly asks about potential side effects for a specific age group.
*   "Ok use karti hu but koi dikkat na ho" - Expresses concern about adverse reactions or general safety before use.
*   "Ye product safe to h" - A direct query for assurance regarding product safety.

These queries reflect a user's proactive concern for health and well-being beyond mere certification, indicating a distinct intent.

While the cluster also contains examples related to language preference ("Tamil") and inquiries about complementary products ("Shampoo ke sath conditioner bhi lena hoga") which may also warrant new intents, the recurrence and critical nature of product safety questions make `About Product > Product Safety` the most prominent and impactful missing intent represented in this cluster concerning core product attributes. Queries like "Scalp par lagaye to" are covered by `[About Product > Product Info]`.

### Cluster ID: 11 (Size: 15)
**Representative Samples:**
- Context:

- Context:  
 New Message: How to track order?...

## Proposal: EXISTING
**Name:** Logistics > Order Status
**Confidence:** High
**Reasoning:** The provided cluster samples, consisting solely of "How to track order?", perfectly align with the existing intent **[Logistics > Order Status]**. The definition for this intent explicitly states: "When the customer talks about the status of an order, or asks for order tracking, or delay in delivery." The phrase "asks for order tracking" directly covers all messages in this cluster.

## Proposal: SPLIT
**Name:** Product Specific Information Requests
**Confidence:** High
**Reasoning:** This cluster is heterogeneous, containing samples that clearly belong to *multiple already defined and distinct intents* within the `About Product` category of the current intent map.

Specifically, the samples include:
*   **Usage Instructions**: Messages such as "How to use it in daily routine?" and "Can I use it after conditioner?" are perfectly aligned with `[About Product > Product Info]`.
*   **Product Benefits/Specialty**: The query "Hair fall khatam hoga" asks about a specific benefit or effect of the product, which is covered by `[About Product > Product Specialty]`.
*   **Product Ingredients**: The message "All ingredients" directly maps to `[About Product > Product Ingredients]`.

Attempting to assign this entire cluster to a single existing intent would result in significant misclassification. This cluster does not represent a new, distinct intent, as all the user needs expressed are already captured by existing granular intents. Therefore, the samples within this cluster should be *split* and re-assigned to their respective, appropriate existing intents.

## Proposal: SPLIT
**Name:** About Product > Product Info (for the majority of samples) and Recommendation > Customer Problem (for the outlier sample)
**Confidence:** High
**Reasoning:**
The majority of the messages in this cluster (4 out of 5 samples) clearly fit the `About Product > Product Info` intent. These messages inquire about specific details related to product usage, application, frequency, expected outcomes, and suitability.

*   "How long for visible results?" - Asks about the timeline for product effects, which is a key piece of product information.
*   "What happens if I stop using?" - Seeks information about the long-term effects or discontinuation, falling under general product information.
*   "How to apply this..?" - Directly asks about product usage instructions.
*   "Is it safe for oily scalp?" - Inquires about product suitability for a specific condition, which is also essential usage information.
*   "Can I use it daily? Advanced Hair Growth Serum..." - Asks about the frequency of use.

The existing intent `About Product > Product Info` is defined as "When the customer wants to know how to use etc or says yes to a question about how to use by the agent." The "etc" in the definition adequately covers the breadth of these product-specific questions, including usage instructions, suitability, and expected timelines.

However, one message in the cluster ("My age is 24 I have white hair...so I dye my hair with black rose mehndi ..once a months..and use oil..of kadipata, and hisbiscus flower home made") is distinctly different. This message is not a direct question about product usage or details. Instead, it provides personal context, details about existing conditions (white hair), and current routines (dyeing, homemade oil). This type of message serves as input for a potential product recommendation and aligns perfectly with the `Recommendation > Customer Problem` intent ("When the customer talks about a personal issue, concern, or challenge they are facing"). It also closely relates to `Recommendation > Customer Concern Related Information`.

Therefore, this cluster represents a mix of two distinct intents. The product-specific questions should continue to map to `About Product > Product Info`, while the message providing personal context for recommendations should be split out and directed to `Recommendation > Customer Problem`.

## Proposal: NEW
**Name:** About Product > Product Reassurance/Skepticism
**Confidence:** High
**Reasoning:**
The cluster samples consistently exhibit a core user intent of seeking reassurance and expressing skepticism about various aspects of the product, which is not fully captured by any single existing intent. While individual samples could be partially mapped to existing atomic intents, the collective sentiment points to a broader, underlying user need for validation and trust-building.

Specifically, the samples demonstrate:

1.  **Safety/Side Effect Concerns:** Users repeatedly ask about potential harm or "side effects," indicating a need for reassurance regarding product safety.
    *   "Lekin isse koi side effect to nahi h na kyuki mere hair bahut sensetive h"
    *   "Kuch problem nehi honge na"
    *   "To serum se koi side effects to nhi"
    While `[About Product > Certification]` covers "harmful chemical free," the direct query about "side effects" and "problems" reflects a more general safety concern that goes beyond just ingredient purity or formal certification.

2.  **Effectiveness Skepticism:** Users express overt doubt about the product's stated efficacy, often based on past experiences or general distrust.
    *   "Mam yahi sab bolte hai sab acha hoga par nahi hota hai"
    This goes beyond simply being "unsure about effectiveness" (`[About Product > Unsure About Effectiveness]`) and implies a need to overcome cynicism or previous disappointments.

3.  **Comparative Validation:** Users question the uniqueness or superiority of the recommended product by citing other known products, suggesting a need to validate the product's value proposition against competitors.
    *   "Lekin or bhi to produce hai jese ki piliex , aadivasi hear oil"
    While `[About Product > Comparison]` exists, this specific query is framed as a challenge or doubt about the *recommended* product's standing, rather than a neutral request for comparison data.

This cluster is not a simple fit for a single existing intent, nor is it a split from an existing one. Instead, it represents a **missing overarching intent** that captures the user's emotional state and need for deeper validation (reassurance, building trust, addressing skepticism) across different facets of the product (safety, effectiveness, competitive advantage). A `About Product > Product Reassurance/Skepticism` intent would allow the conversational AI to identify this deeper user need and respond with more holistic, trust-building messaging rather than fragmented, direct answers to isolated questions.

- Context: human: How to track order? - ai: I'm sorry, but I can't find any information associated wit...

## Proposal: EXISTING
**Name:** Logistics > Order Status
**Confidence:** High
**Reasoning:** The cluster samples predominantly consist of user messages explicitly asking for order tracking or inquiring about the status and delivery timeline of their orders. Phrases such as "How to track order?", "Help me track order", "when I can receive the order?", and "Where is my order" are direct matches for the existing intent `[Logistics > Order Status]`. The description for this intent is "When the customer talks about the status of an order, or asks for order tracking, or delay in delivery," which perfectly encompasses all messages in this cluster.

## Proposal: EXISTING
**Name:** Recommendation > Seeking Solution
**Confidence:** High
**Reasoning:** The samples in this cluster predominantly feature customers describing a personal skin or hair concern and explicitly or implicitly asking for product recommendations or solutions to address that concern.

While some messages initially state the problem (e.g., "I have dryness skin", "Dry skin h mera", "My skin is dry and fish skin type", "For face pimples"), these are almost invariably followed by or coupled with a request for a solution or suggestion in the conversational flow, such as:
*   "Can u give any suggestions for that"
*   "And also I have straberry skin" (leading to suggestions)
*   "Nicotinamide is the best for dry sking&&It is right??" (inquiring about an ingredient as a solution)
*   "Niacinamide nd salicylic acid which one best best for reducing dry skin" (comparing solutions for a problem)
*   "How can reduce the strawberry skin"
*   "Which moisturizer" / "Any u suggest"
*   "Can u suggest for black colour in the elbow and knee"
*   "Best for oily skin" (implies both problem and seeking recommendation)
*   "Body scrub for dry skin" (implies both problem and seeking recommendation for a product category)

These align directly with the definition of `[Recommendation > Seeking Solution]`: "When customer asks recommendation for a product/category for their skin/hair type." While `[Recommendation > Customer Problem]` (When the customer talks about a personal issue...) captures the initial problem statement, the overarching user goal demonstrated by this cluster is to actively find a solution, which is best encompassed by `[Recommendation > Seeking Solution]`.

One sample ("I want to information this item, Advance Hair growth serum") could fall under `[About Product > Product Info]`, but it is an outlier in this cluster, which is overwhelmingly focused on problem-based recommendations.

### Cluster ID: 5 (Size: 10)
**Representative Samples:**

## Proposal: SPLIT
**Name:** About Product > Product Failure Resolution (New Intent Identified within Cluster)
**Confidence:** High
**Reasoning:** This cluster represents a split because it contains messages that clearly belong to multiple existing intents within the `CURRENT INTENT MAP`, and also introduces a concept that warrants a new, distinct intent.

Specifically:
1.  **Existing Intent: `[About Product > Product Specialty]`**: Messages like "What's special about it? Hair Fall Control Shampoo with Peptides" and "New Message: Yes" (in response to "Would you like to know what makes the product special...") directly align with this intent, as they inquire about the unique characteristics or benefits of a product.
2.  **Existing Intent: `[About Product > Product Info]`**: The message "New Message: Is the shampoo fopd for daily use" clearly falls under `Product Info`, as it asks about the usage instructions or frequency ("how to use daily").
3.  **Missing Intent (Proposed): `About Product > Product Failure Resolution`**: The message "New Message: When this shampoo doesn't work..what will we do?" is distinct. It goes beyond merely being "Unsure About Effectiveness" (which implies initial doubt) or expressing a "Complaint" (which states dissatisfaction). Instead, it's a proactive query about potential next steps, guarantees, or policies in the event that the product fails to deliver its promised results. This type of query regarding recourse for product ineffectiveness is not adequately covered by existing intents and warrants a new intent to address customer questions about resolutions, warranties, or refunds when a product doesn't perform as expected.

Therefore, the cluster needs to be split, with messages distributed to `[About Product > Product Specialty]`, `[About Product > Product Info]`, and a new intent to handle queries about product failure resolution.

## Proposal: NEW
**Name:** About Product > Add to Cart
**Confidence:** High
**Reasoning:** The sample "Add to cart - AHA Body Lotion with Niacinamide & Shea Butter" clearly indicates a user's request to perform an action: adding a specific product to their shopping cart. This is a direct command or request for a transactional action.

None of the existing intents specifically cover this.
*   `[About Product > Place Order]` is defined as "When the customer asks *how to place an order*", which focuses on inquiries about the ordering process, not the direct action of adding items to a cart.
*   Other samples in the cluster fit existing intents (e.g., "Which facewash is good for brighter face" -> `Recommendation > Seeking Solution`; "Oily skin" -> `Recommendation > Customer Concern Related Information`; "How to use it in daily routine?" -> `About Product > Product Info`). However, the "Add to cart" instruction is a distinct and crucial e-commerce interaction that warrants its own intent for accurate bot handling and fulfillment.

### Cluster ID: 1 (Size: 10)
**Representative Samples:**

- Context:  
 New Message: Hi...

## Proposal: SPLIT
**Name:** Split between `[Basic Interactions > Greetings]` and `[About Product > Product Info]`
**Confidence:** High
**Reasoning:** The provided cluster samples contain messages that clearly belong to two separate, existing intents based on the current intent map.
*   The messages "Hi", "Hii", and "Hello" are explicit greetings and perfectly align with the definition of `[Basic Interactions > Greetings]` ("When a customer gives greetings only like Hi, hello, thank you etc.").
*   The message "How to use" is a direct query about product usage. This matches the definition of `[About Product > Product Info]` ("When the customer wants to know how to use etc or says yes to a question about how to use by the agent.")
Therefore, this cluster should be split, with the greeting messages mapped to `[Basic Interactions > Greetings]` and the usage query mapped to `[About Product > Product Info]`.

## Proposal: NEW
**Name:** User Providing Contact Details
**Confidence:** High
**Reasoning:** This cluster contains several instances where the user proactively provides their personal contact information (like email or phone number) to the AI for identification, follow-up, or to facilitate contact. This distinct behavior is not covered by any existing intent.

*   **Sample 1:** The user states, `human: My phone number 9789395973` and then in the `New Message: sanjaymahesh962@gmail.com`. This is a clear instance of the user providing their contact details.
*   **Sample 5:** The user explicitly asks the AI to contact them by providing their number: `human: Tum contact kro @9643487687 my number` and `human: Kindly contact me asap`.

This proposed intent is crucial for handling user identification and handover scenarios. It is distinct from `[About Company > Contact Details]`, which is defined as "When a customer asks about the company's contact specifically," as the samples show the user *giving* their own contact information, not *asking for* the company's.

While the cluster also contains messages that fit existing intents (e.g., "Customer care number" in Sample 3 fits `[About Company > Contact Details]`, and "Cancel my order" in Sample 4 fits `[Logistics > Cancellation]`) and another potential new intent ("Review dal diya hun ...." in Sample 5 implying external action notification), the pattern of "User Providing Contact Details" is a significant and recurring missing interaction within this cluster.

### Cluster ID: 8 (Size: 8)
**Representative Samples:**
- Context: human: Hello - ai: Hello! Hope you’re doing well. How may I assist you? - human: I order so...
- Context: human: Expected delivery date - ai: I'm sorry, but I can't find any information associated ...

## Proposal: SPLIT
**Name:** Logistics > Delivery Partner Communication
**Confidence:** High
**Reasoning:** This cluster contains a mix of intents, but a recurring theme points to a specific gap. While queries like "I didn't receive my order" (when the bot implies fulfillment) fit `[Logistics > Marked Delivered, Not Received]`, general delays like "It's also takes so much days" or "Expected delivery date" fit `[Logistics > Order Status]`, cancellation requests fit `[Logistics > Cancellation]`, and refund requests fit `[Logistics > Refund Required]`, there's a distinct pattern emerging around the *delivery partner's interaction*.

Specifically, messages such as:
*   "Delivery partner didn't call me"
*   "I didn't receive any call from delevery partner"
*   "Can you give my delevery partner contact"
*   "Number so I can call" (in response to not getting delivery partner contact)

These phrases indicate a user's concern about the communication (or lack thereof) from the delivery agent or a direct request for the delivery partner's contact information. This is a specific type of delivery issue that is not solely about order status, tracking, or a discrepancy in delivery status. It is about the *process of delivery communication*. Therefore, a split from the broader `Logistics` domain, specifically to capture these interactions related to delivery partner communication, is highly recommended.

### Cluster ID: 10 (Size: 6)
**Representative Samples:**
- Context:  
 New Message: What's special about it? Salicylic Acid Face Wash for Acne & Oil Control- 1...
- Context: human: What's special about it? Salicylic Acid Face Wash for Acne & Oil Control- 100ml - ai...

## Proposal: SPLIT
**Name:** Mixed Intent Cluster
**Confidence:** High
**Reasoning:** This cluster is highly heterogeneous, containing messages that clearly map to multiple distinct existing intents within the `CURRENT INTENT MAP`. It does not represent a single new intent, nor does it fit neatly into any single existing intent.

Specifically, the samples demonstrate:
*   **[About Product > Product Specialty]**:
    *   "What's special about it?"
    *   "Aesa special kya h jo ham kharede isko" (What's so special that we should buy it?)
*   **[About Product > Unsure About Effectiveness]**:
    *   "...thik ho jaye ga kya garanty h ?" (...is there any guarantee it will fix it?)
    *   "Ye mere pimple ko bhi thik kar dega" (Will this fix my pimples too?)
    *   "Kya ye acne or sensitive par bhi kam karta h" (Does this also work on acne and sensitive skin?)
    *   "Is it better for oil scalp ?"
*   **[About Product > Product Ingredients]**:
    *   "Salicylic acid ka matlab kya h" (What does Salicylic acid mean?)
*   **[Recommendation > Customer Problem]**:
    *   "Oil skin"
    *   "Mujhe acne breakouts bhi h" (I also have acne breakouts)

Given this clear diversity, the cluster should be split, and its individual messages should be assigned to their respective existing intent categories.

**Representative Samples:**

- Context: human: Company name - ai: Hello! Hope you’re doing well this evening. How may I assist you ...

## Proposal: SPLIT
**Name:** [Logistics > Sales Event Timing]
**Confidence:** Medium
**Reasoning:**
This cluster contains a mix of user messages, indicating a need for re-evaluation of the current clustering rather than the entire cluster representing a single new or existing intent.

Specifically:
*   "How to track order" and "My order company name" clearly map to **[Logistics > Order Status]**.
*   "Is my amount refunded already" clearly maps to **[Logistics > Refund Policy]** (specifically the status aspect of the description).

However, the messages "Sale kab se start h" (appearing twice) represent a distinct user intent that is not optimally captured by the current taxonomy. The existing intent `[Logistics > Discount]` is defined as "When the customer asks about offers or discounts available for a product." While a sale is a type of offer/discount, the query "Sale kab se start h" specifically asks about the *timing* or *start date* of a *general promotional event* rather than about *current discounts available for a specific product*.

This distinction is crucial for effective conversational AI:
1.  **Information Retrieval:** Answering "when a sale starts" requires access to a promotional calendar or future marketing plans, whereas "what discounts are available for X product" requires checking current product catalog pricing.
2.  **User Expectation:** Users asking about sale timings are often planning purchases around future events.

Therefore, a **split** from `[Logistics > Discount]` is proposed to create a new intent, `[Logistics > Sales Event Timing]`. This new intent would specifically handle inquiries about the schedule or start dates of upcoming sales, promotional periods, or general company-wide offers. The original `[Logistics > Discount]` intent can then be refined to focus more exclusively on inquiries about *current, specific product-level* offers and discounts.

The confidence is Medium because, while the need for this split is clear for the "Sale kab se start h" samples, the cluster itself is heterogeneous, with other samples fitting existing intents. The proposal focuses on addressing the most salient taxonomic gap identified within the cluster.

## Proposal: SPLIT
**Name:** About Product > Product Info
**Confidence:** High
**Reasoning:** This cluster exhibits a clear mix of distinct user intents, necessitating a split to ensure accurate classification.

1.  **Majority to `[About Product > Product Info]`:** The predominant theme across the samples is how to use products, including the order of application when multiple products are involved. Phrases like "How to use it in daily routine?", "Shampoo or serum ko kse use kre", "Before use serum oil can be applied", "Both use same time", and "Can you tell me how to used hair fall shampoo" directly align with the existing intent `[About Product > Product Info]` ("When the customer wants to know how to use etc"). These messages should remain mapped to this intent.

2.  **Split to `[About Product > Unsure About Effectiveness]`:** The message "After using this serum my hair will fall?" (from Sample 4) expresses a concern or question about a potential negative side effect or the product's effectiveness. This aligns perfectly with the intent `[About Product > Unsure About Effectiveness]` ("When the customer is not sure about the effectiveness of the product"), and clearly deviates from simple usage instructions.

3.  **Potential New Intent for `Product Quantity`:** The message "I asked about quantity" (from Sample 3) explicitly queries the volume or size of a product. This information is distinct from "how to use" instructions and is not clearly covered by any existing intent. While "etc" in `Product Info` could be broadly interpreted, a query about quantity is a specific product specification that warrants consideration for a new, dedicated intent such as `[About Product > Product Quantity]` or `[About Product > Product Specifications]` if similar queries are frequent.

Given these distinct topics within a single cluster, a split is essential to correctly categorize these user needs into their respective intents.

## Proposal: EXISTING
**Name:** N/A (Multiple Existing Intents)
**Confidence:** High
**Reasoning:** This cluster contains samples that are well-covered by several existing intents within the current intent map.

*   Samples 1 and 2: "What's special about it?" directly map to **[About Product > Product Specialty]** as they inquire about the unique qualities or benefits of a specific product.
*   Sample 3: "How to use it in daily routine?" directly maps to **[About Product > Product Info]** which covers questions about how to use a product.
*   Sample 4: "Isn't it rupees 10" clearly refers to the price of a product and therefore maps to **[About Product > Pricing]**.
*   Sample 5: The message "time" in the context of previous turns about "my order eppo delivery avu" (When will my order be delivered?) and "Product eppo ethum" (When will the product arrive?) indicates a query about delivery time, which falls under **[Logistics > Order Status]**.

Since all samples can be accurately classified under existing intents, there is no need for a new intent or a split. This cluster appears to be a mix of messages that should be routed to their respective predefined intents.

### Cluster ID: 15 (Size: 5)
**Representative Samples:**
- Context:  
 New Message: Where is my order ...
- Context:  
 New Message: Why my order are not delivering??? Whats the reason ...

## Proposal: SPLIT
**Name:** N/A (Cluster requires splitting into existing intents)
**Confidence:** High
**Reasoning:** This cluster contains messages that clearly fall into two distinct, already existing intents within the `Logistics` domain.

*   Samples inquiring about the location, delivery status, delays, or reasons for a specific order state (like "RTO in transit") directly align with the `[Logistics > Order Status]` intent. Examples include:
    *   "Where is my order "
    *   "Why my order are not delivering??? Whats the reason "
    *   "My order 10 delayed "
    *   "RTO in transit my order why"

*   The sample asking about the procedure or guidelines for returning an order ("How can I return an order?") precisely matches the definition of the `[Logistics > Return Policy]` intent.

Therefore, the cluster should be split, with messages directed to their respective existing intents.
