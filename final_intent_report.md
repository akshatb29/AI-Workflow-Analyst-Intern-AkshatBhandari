## 2. Detailed Findings
### 🔴 Cluster 2: NEW -> Basic Interactions > Out of Scope
**Reasoning:** The cluster includes messages that are unsolicited social expressions ('I love you') and unintelligible inputs ('Boio'), which are not covered by any existing functional or basic interaction intents. This necessitates a new intent for handling non-query, conversational, or unclassifiable inputs that fall outside the defined categories.

### 🔴 Cluster 6: NEW -> About Product > Product Safety
**Reasoning:** Several messages explicitly ask about product safety and potential side effects, particularly for a child (e.g., 'Age 10 year h koi side effects', 'Ye product safe to h'). This concern is not adequately captured by existing intents like 'About Product > Certification', which focuses on chemical-free status and formal certifications, not general safety or specific adverse reactions.

### Mf Cluster 8: SPLIT -> Logistics > Order Not Received
**Reasoning:** This cluster predominantly features customers reporting that they have not received their order, indicating a critical delivery failure beyond a simple status check or minor delay. While 'Order Status' covers delays, the emphasis here is on non-receipt as a problem, warranting a specific intent for these more severe delivery issues.
